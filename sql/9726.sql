-- Objective: Classift each business as either a restaurant, cafe, school, or other.
-- Output: business_name, business_type  
-- Assumptions: 
    -- 1) There could be businesses that fall into more than one category.
    -- 2) The most important data-point is the business_name column, which means the rest of the columns can be ignored.
-- Process: 
    -- STEP 1: Change all names into lowercase so CASE function can take into account of names without capital letters. 
        -- Then, classify business according to their categories.
        -- Also, remove duplicates.
